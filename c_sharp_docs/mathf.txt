Mathf
Switch to Scripting

Unity’s Mathf class provides a collection of common math functions, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and other functions commonly required in games and app development.

This page provides an overview of the Mathf class and its common uses when scripting with it. For an exhaustive reference of every member of the Mathf class, see the Mathf script reference.
Trigonometric

All Unity’s trigonometry functions work in radians.

    Sin
    Cos
    Tan
    Asin
    Acos
    Atan
    Atan2

PI is available as a constant, and you can multiply by the static values Rad2Deg or Deg2Rad to convert between radians and degrees.
Powers and Square Roots

Unity provides the common power and square root functions you would expect: - Pow - Sqrt - Exp

As well as some useful power-of-two related functions. These are useful when working with common binary data sizes, which are often constrained or optimized to power-of-two values (such as texture dimensions):

    ClosestPowerOfTwo
    NextPowerOfTwo
    IsPowerOfTwo

Interpolation

Unity’s interpolation functions allows you to calculate a value that is some way between two given points. Each of these functions behaves in a different way, suitable for different situations. See the examples in each for more information:

    Lerp
    LerpAngle
    LerpUnclamped
    InverseLerp
    MoveTowards
    MoveTowardsAngle
    SmoothDamp
    SmoothDampAngle
    SmoothStep

Note that the Vector classes and the Quaternion class all have their own interpolation functions (such as Quaternion.Lerp) which allow you to interpolate positions, directions and rotations in multiple dimensions.
Limiting and repeating values

These simple helper functions are often useful in games or apps and can save you time when you need to limit values to a certain range or repeat them within a certain range.

    Max and Min
    Repeat and PingPong
    Clamp and Clamp01
    Ceil and Floor

Logarithmic

The Log function allows you to calculate the logarithm of a specified number, either the natural logarithm or in a specified base. Additionally the Log10 function returns the base–10 logarithm of the specified number.
